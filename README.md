# 🏡 BukitVista Property Insights
Enhancing Listings Through Data Science

## Project Overview

This project is part of a Data Science internship at BukitVista, where the goal is to create an interactive dashboard that provides insightful analytics on property listings. The dashboard includes various visualizations and analyses to help better understand pricing trends, property features, and top recommendations.

The dashboard was built using **Streamlit** and integrates two datasets:
1. **BukitVista Listing Dataset**: includes property details such as Property Name, Features, Address, Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Property type, and Price.
2. **Traveloka Dataset** (External Source as the Market Competitor): includes information on properties, such as Property Name, Facilities, Price, Rating, and Location.

## Contents

- **📈 Price Distribution per Night**: Displays the histogram of price per night across listings.
- **🔎 Price Analysis**: A detailed price analysis to understand how prices change with guest capacity, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
- **✨ Most Common Feature Available**: Displays the most common property features by area.
- **📊 Price Distribution by Feature**: Bar chart showing average price based on features across areas.
- **🤑 Price per Night Comparison**: Compares property prices across areas from BukitVista and competitor data.
- **🌟🌟🌟 Best-Value Villas: Rating & Price Insights**: Highlights the best value villas with the lowest price and highest predicted rating.

The dashboard is interactive and updates dynamically based on user-selected filters for a more personalized analysis.
